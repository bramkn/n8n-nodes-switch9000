# n8n-nodes-switch9000

This is an n8n community node. It lets you create a switch with an infinite number of routes. 
For as long as you n8n instance allows it of course. 
It is unsure how n8n would perform with a node that has over 9000 outputs.


[n8n](https://n8n.io/) is a [fair-code licensed](https://docs.n8n.io/reference/license/) workflow automation platform.

## Installation

Follow the [installation guide](https://docs.n8n.io/integrations/community-nodes/installation/) in the n8n community nodes documentation.

## Compatibility

Developed and tested in version 0.193.3
The code from the switch node was borrowed in the development of this node. So probably as long as the switch node works, this one will work as well.

## Usage

When placing the node, you need to choose the mode of it. You can choose between Reciever and Sender.
